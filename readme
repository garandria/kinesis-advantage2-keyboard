Since I always forget it:
* Power User Mode:

  > 7.3 Power User Mode, “PUM” (progm + Shift + Esc)
  >
  > Before accessing any of the Power User Tools described below, it its first necessary to activate Power User
  > Mode (PUM) on the keyboard using the onboard shortcut. To do this, press and hold the Program Key and
  > the Shift Key, and then tap the Escape Key. All four LED indicator lights will flash four times to indicate when
  > PUM has been activated, and two times to indicate when it has been deactivated. Note: When PUM is active,
  > a new line on the Status Report will appears to indicate this. When it is inactive, it is not listed in the Status
  > Report. If you attempt to activate one of the features below without having first activated PUM, nothing will
  > happen. Once activated, PUM will stay active until it is manually deactivated or a Hard Reset is performed.
